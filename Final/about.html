		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>The Food Intake Tracker was created by Tristin Houston, an unregistered dietitian with ~3 weeks of experience helping people achieve their health and wellness goals. Tristin noticed that many of his family members struggled with tracking their food intake and understanding the nutritional content of their meals. He wanted to create a simple and user-friendly tool that would make it easier for people to monitor their nutrient intake and make healthier choices.</p>
		<p>With the Food Intake Tracker, users can easily log their meals and snacks, and the tool will automatically calculate their intake of various vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. The tracker also provides personalized recommendations based on the user's dietary goals and needs, making it easy to stay on track and achieve optimal health.</p>
